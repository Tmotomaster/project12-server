# How to start your server
1. Clone this repository on your server.
2. Install the latest version of *CPython3* or preferrably ***PyPy3***, since it's usually faster (on Linux, run `sudo apt install pypy3`).
3. Run `realbusiness.py` with your chosen interpreter (run something like `pypy3 realbusiness.py` in your terminal).
4. The server should be up and running! Now configure the client game to connect to your server.
5. *Rethink your life choices since the previous step is impossible (uh, very difficult) thus far.*
